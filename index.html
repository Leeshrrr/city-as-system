            Ebony was diagnosed with lead poisoning at the age of 2. Ebony's malady came from eating paint chips from a window sill in the apartment where her family lived in the Saint Louis University campus, as her mother Debbie Thomas-Smith later concluded. Doctors
            told Debbie and her father Zachary that Ebony would likely suffer from cognitive impairments for the rest of her life. Even so, she managed to earn a bachelor's degree and dual master's degrees in Business Management and Information Systems
            by midlife. Her career with the nation's largest campus bookstore operator spanned nearly 14 years, as she raised two sons, Clayton and Khamari, and parented two nieces, Mykinzi and Mareah, through their teens and into adulthood. She is now

            It's not just the lead paint in New York's public housing that are at risk of lead poisoning. When plumbing fixtures that contain lead corrode, lead can enter drinking water, especially when the water has high acidity or low mineral content, which corrodes
            pipes and fixtures. The most common origins of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and fixtures. Water originating from lead pipes connected to the water main, also known as lead service lines, is typically the main source of lead
            in household water. Expserts suspect that the drinking water in New York's public schools may also be tainted with lead. Lead contaminates public school drinking water through corroded lead pipes and fixtures, especially in buildings built
            before 1986.

            A failed system cannot be left alone to continue its bad effects. People try to correct positive feedback loops from the opposite side. The governments and some organizations are looking for solutions to lead poisoning. Their actions range from solving
            existing problems — lead cleanup campaigns — to correcting future path — education. Follow the links below to learn about their efforts.

            In 2019, the  Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic at the Washington University School of Law provided a report to the community. Citing figures from 2016,  researchers reported that <span class="underline05"> Black children were “<span class = "highlight10"> 2.4 </span>times
            more likely than white children </span>to test positive for lead in their blood and account for more than 70 percent of children found to suffer from lead poisoning.”
        </div>
        <div class="main-text">
            University of Pennsylvania’s researcher Claudia López Lloreda’s report reveals that <span class="underline06"> children living in poverty suffer greater cognitive and physical effects from lead exposure than children from richer families</span>,
            even if they live in the same area. Lead poisoning hits low-income children harder than their affluent neighbors.

    <div class="evaluation-text03">

        <div class="main-text">
            The best way to eliminate lead poisoning is <span class="highlight11">regular testing</span>. This allows early detection of symptoms of high blood lead and prompt treatment to prevent the subsequent effects. However, <span class="underline07">lood lead tests are expensive,
            usually costing around $30 to $100</span>. This stops some families with low-income from getting their children tested for blood lead. But it is these families that are more likely to have high blood lead levels children because they often
            live in old houses, public housing or in districts with serious pollution.
        </div>
        <div class="main-text">
            And usually highly educated people have higher consciousness of prevention of lead poisoning. The <span class="underline07">low class and income families have no awareness and no energy to care for the children's blood lead level</span>, until
            their children have shown the corresponding symptoms - usually means that lead has already been very deeply into their bodies - and will suffer in the whole life.

        </div>

    <div id="trigger23"></div>
    <div class="evaluation-text04">

        <div class="main-text">
            The right thing we should do is to <span class="highlight12"> popularize the blood lead testing</span> to every family, and only by reducing the cost of blood lead testing can it be made widely available so that more families in need can get
            their children tested. So we call on <span class="underline09">testing institutions to provide affordable blood lead tests</span> , and we also call on <span class="underline10"> public interest organizations to sponsor the tests</span>. At
            the same time, efforts are under way to make blood lead testing fully covered by health insurance. Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller said, medical tests for lead exposure must be covered fully by health insurance as a preventative
            service for children.
