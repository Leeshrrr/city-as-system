            At age 2, Ebony was diagnosed with lead poisoning. Ebony’s malady — as her mother Debbie Thomas-Smith later determined — came from eating paint chips from a window sill in the apartment where her family was living on the campus of Saint Louis University.
            Doctors told her mother, Debbie, and father, Zachary, she likely would suffer from cognitive impairments the rest of her life. But by midlife, Ebony had managed to earn a bachelor’s degree and dual master’s degrees in business management and
            information systems. She would go on to serve for nearly 14 years with the nation’s largest operator of campus bookstores, while also raising two sons, Clayton, 5, and Khamari, 16, and parenting two beloved nieces, Mykinzi, 20,  and Mareah,
            23, through their adolescence. She is now helping  “Kinzi” and “ReeRee” chart successful career paths of their own.

        However, despite the ongoing fight against lead, high blood lead rates continue to affect children. Areas of high lead exposure risk remain throughout America’s largest and richest city, an exploration of blood testing data found. In the first examination
        of its kind, reporters obtained New York childhood blood testing data down to the census tract level – neighborhood areas with some 4,000 residents apiece. In densely populated New York, a tract often covers several square blocks.

    <div class="main-text">
        While poisoning has nearly been eliminated in many neighborhoods, Reuters identified 69 New York City census tracts where at least 10 percent of small children screened over an 11-year period, from 2005 to 2015, had elevated lead levels.That is twice
        the rate found across Flint, Michigan, during the peak of its notorious water contamination crisis in 2014 and 2015, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 5 percent of children’s tests were high.

            One of the most common sources of lead poisoning is lead paint.
        </div>
        <div class="main-text">
            New York outlawed residential lead paint in 1960, 18 years before a national ban. A 2004 housing law targeted “elimination” of childhood lead poisoning within six years. The city offers free lead testing in housing, vows to fix hazards and bill landlords
            when necessary, and has seen childhood exposure rates decline year after year.

            Yet inspectors didn’t visit the Brooklyn apartment where Barbara Ellis lived until after her twin daughters tested high for lead three years in a row, she said. They found peeling lead paint on doors and windows. The girls required speech and occupational
            therapy for their developmental delays, common among lead-exposed children.

            In November 2017, Mark Peters, the director of Department of Investigation Commissioner released a detailed report that revealed lead paint hazards in 55,000 of 178,000 apartments, including 4,321 homes with children under the age of six.Tests by the
            NYC bureau of Investigation said that children living in 18 apartments had excessive levels of lead in their bodies, and records from housing authority show that 202 children living in 133 Housing Authority apartments between 2011 and 2016
            had high levels of lead in their blood.

    <div class="main-text">
        In addition, pollution from water sources is also a major cause, as the well-known Flint water crisis. </div>
    <div class="main-text">
        It's not just children in New York's public housing that are at risk of lead poisoning. Lead can enter drinking water when plumbing materials that contain lead corrode, especially where the water has high acidity or low mineral content that corrodes pipes
        and fixtures. The most common sources of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and fixtures. In homes with lead pipes that connect the home to the water main, also known as lead services lines, these pipes are typically the most significant
        source of lead in the water. Experts suspect that the drinking water in New York's schools may also be tainted with lead. Lead contaminates public school drinking water through corroded lead pipes and fixtures, especially in buildings built before
        1986.
