            Ebony was diagnosed with lead poisoning at the age of 2. Ebony's malady came from eating paint chips from a window sill in the apartment where her family lived on the Saint Louis University campus, as her mother Debbie Thomas-Smith later concluded. Doctors
            told Debbie, and her father, Zachary that Ebony would likely suffer from cognitive impairments for the rest of her life. Even so, she managed to earn a bachelor's degree and dual master's degrees in Business Management and Information Systems
            by midlife. Her career with the nation's largest campus bookstore operator spanned nearly 14 years, as she raised two sons, Clayton and Khamari, and parented two nieces, Mykinzi and Mareah, through their teens and into adulthood. She is now
            guiding two other teenagers in charting their own career paths. </div>

    <div class="main-text">
        It's not just children in New York's public housing that are at risk of lead poisoning. When plumbing fixtures that contain lead corrode, lead can enter drinking water, especially when the water has high acidity or low mineral content, which corrodes
        pipes and fixtures. The most common origins of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and fixtures. Water originating from lead pipes connected to the water main, also known as lead service lines, is typically the main source of lead
        in household water. Experts suspect that the drinking water in New York's public schools may also be tainted with lead. Lead contaminates public school drinking water through corroded lead pipes and fixtures, especially in buildings built before
        1986.
