            At age 2, Ebony was diagnosed with lead poisoning. Ebony’s malady — as her mother Debbie Thomas-Smith later determined — came from eating paint chips from a window sill in the apartment where her family was living on the campus of Saint Louis University.
            Doctors told her mother, Debbie, and father, Zachary, she likely would suffer from cognitive impairments the rest of her life. But by midlife, Ebony had managed to earn a bachelor’s degree and dual master’s degrees in business management and
            information systems. She would go on to serve for nearly 14 years with the nation’s largest operator of campus bookstores, while also raising two sons, Clayton, 5, and Khamari, 16, and parenting two beloved nieces, Mykinzi, 20,  and Mareah,
            23, through their adolescence. She is now helping  “Kinzi” and “ReeRee” chart successful career paths of their own.
